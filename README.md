Hi! I'm Alex Zaharia.

I'm fascinated by how we learn, share, and optimize information. My current research explores:
- Information Theory â€“ How information is structured, transmitted, and refined for better understanding.
- Temporal Dynamics â€“ The impact of time on learning, decision-making, and communication.
- Learning Rate Optimization â€“ Helping individuals, teams, and organizations learn faster and more effectively.
- Information Dissemination â€“ Finding better ways to share and retain knowledge across different networks.

Always open to discussions and collaborationsâ€”letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€
